# `.dena`

![dena](https://github.com/ylcnky/Dena/blob/master/logo.png "`.dena`")

Coding a new programming language named `dena/` with Rust. This project is inspired from the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) which covers almost everything needed to implement a full-featured, efficient programming language. The book cover these steps in [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) language; and this project tries to implement the same stack with Rust.

It is obvious, this development does not cover all the features and functionalities included in the [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) book. However, many essential features are handled.

## Features
* It is a dynamically typed language (`Python` lovers welcome ✅)
* It does not compile. Code runs with an interpreter

## Why I named as `.dena`? 
Why not? 

**I ❤️ Dena**
