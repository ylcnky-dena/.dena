# `dena_`

Coding a new programming language named `dena` with Rust. This project is inspired from the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) which covers almost everything needed to implement a new programming full-featured, efficient scripting language. The book cover these steps in Java language. This project tries to implement the same stack with Rust.
