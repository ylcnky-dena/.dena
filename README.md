# `dena/`

Coding a new programming language named `dena/` with Rust. This project is inspired from the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) which covers almost everything needed to implement a full-featured, efficient programming language. The book cover these steps in Java language. This project tries to implement the same stack with Rust.

### Why I named as `dena/`? 
Who cares? I just ❤️ Dena
